Accomplished Thus Far : 

    All of the page layout has been completed with the style sheets.
    Menu is completed, but it is static and the links should point to real locations, not just the same one.

Next Steps :

    The hero image needs to be not displayed on pages where it does not belong and it needs to be invisible --- take up no space
    Put in some JavaScript to slick up the appearance a bit.  
    Add some functionality to animate some of the images and make the menus more interactive.
